== Definition

The base file in the MUnit Framework is the *MUnit Test Suite file*. These files are the `.xml` files located under the `src/test/munit` folder in your Mule application's folder structure. Each MUnit Test Suite file is a collection of MUnit tests. It is meant to work on its own, and should be able to run independently from other MUnit test suite files.

== Components of an MUnit Test Suite

An MUnit test suite file should contain any combination of the following components:

* <<Imports>>
* Bean Definitions
* <<Before/After Suites>>
* <<Before/After Tests>>
* <<MUnit Tests>>

TIP: Each MUnit test suite file is, behind the scenes, no different than a Mule
application XML file. You can use several of the Mule top level elements such as xref:3.8@mule-runtime::flows-and-subflows.adoc[flow, sub-flow], xref:3.8@mule-management-console::automating-tasks-using-scripts.adoc[scripts], etc.

== Imports
=== Defining Imports

Each MUnit suite is meant to test a particular set of Mule flows. To do that, you need to tell MUnit where those flows are defined in your application structure. For this we use _imports_, which are in fact _spring imports_.

WARNING: If your application is spread across multiple files and the components in those files cross-reference each other, you need to import all of the files.

TIP: Ideally, your production code and your flows should be arranged in a cohesive way -- this improves readability, maintainability and testability.

== Before/After Suites
=== Defining Before and After Suites

As with other testing frameworks, MUnit provides certain features around the test suite concept.
In particular, you can add processing/actions to be run _before_ and/or _after_ the entire
MUnit Test Suite executions.

==== Defining a Before Suite

The MUnit Before Suite is a scope. It can contain code that is meant to be executed *_before_* the whole suite.

For instance, let's suppose you have an MUnit Test Suite file with four tests. The code inside an MUnit Before Suite runs just once, before your four tests.

The MUnit Before Suite is a __top level scope__, so you can have as many Before Suites as you need. They all follow the same execution rule: _Run before the tests, just once_.

WARNING: If there is more than one Before Suite, MUnit does not guarantee the order in which the Before Suites run amongst themselves.

TIP: One instance in which the MUnit Before Suite is useful is when you need to set up a test environment before the whole test runs.

==== Defining an After Suite

The MUnit After Suite is a scope. It can contain code that is meant to be executed _after_ the whole suite.

For instance, let's suppose you have an MUnit Test Suite File with four tests. The code inside an MUnit After Suite, _runs just once, after all your tests_.

The MUnit After Suite is a __top level scope__, thus you can have as many After Suites as you need.
They all follow the same execution rule: _Run after the tests, just once_.

WARNING: If there is more than one After Suite, MUnit does not guarantee the order in which the After Suites run amongst themselves.

== Before/After Tests
=== Defining Before and After Tests

MUnit provides the ability to perform _Before_ and _After_ tests. These are similar to the concepts defined by JUnit. You can add processing/actions to be run _before_ and/or _after_ the execution of each MUnit Test suite.

==== Defining a Before Test

The MUnit Before Test is a scope. It can contain code that is meant to be executed _before each_ test.

For instance, let's suppose you have an MUnit Test Suite file with four tests. The code inside an MUnit Before test _runs before *each* of your four tests_; it runs four times.

The MUnit Before Test is a __top-level scope__, thus you can have as many Before tests as you need. They all follow the same execution rule: _Run before each test_.

WARNING: If there is more than one Before test, MUnit does not guarantee the order in which the Before tests run amongst themselves.

== MUnit Tests
=== Defining an MUnit Test

The *MUnit Test* is the basic building block of an MUnit Test Suite. It represents each test scenario you want to try.

.MUnit Test Attributes
[cols="30,70"]
|===
|Name |Description

|`name`
|*Mandatory.* Defines the name of the test. The name must be unique inside the test suite.

|`description`
|*Mandatory.* Describes the scenario being tested.

|`ignore`
|Defines if the test should be ignored. If not present, the test is not ignored.

|`expectException`
|Defines the exception that should be received after the execution of this test.

|===

==== Defining Properties

In MUnit, you can load properties from the `mule­-app.properties` file as well as using the `context:property-placeholder` to load properties from an additional file.

MUnit provides several ways to override these properties when running MUnit with Anypoint Studio. Properties for the `mule-app.properties` file are loaded as System properties.

==== Defining an MUnit Test Description

In MUnit, it's mandatory that you write a description in your test, that is, the `description` attribute is mandatory.

Ideally, you should write a useful, representative description of the scenario you are testing. This description displays in the test console before running the test, and also in the reports.

TIP: The more representative the description, the more easy to read and troubleshoot any failures.

==== Defining an MUnit Test To Ignore

There may be scenarios where you need to shoot-down a test. Whether this be because the test is failing or because it has nasty side effects. +
The point is you shouldn't have to comment out the code.

In this case, MUnit allows you to ignore a specific test.

You can ignore any of your tests by adding the `ignore` boolean to the test definition, as shown below.

----
<munit:test name="my-flow-Test"
      ignore="true"
      description="Test to verify scenario 1">
</munit:test>
----
TIP: Valid values for `ignore` are *true* and *false*. If the attribute is not present, the default is false.
=====

==== Defining an Expected Exception

Sometimes, the only thing you want to validate is that the flow or sub-flow you are testing fails and throws a specific exception, which depends on the business logic being tested. In these cases, MUnit provides a simple way to validate the scenario.

In these cases you can add the attribute `expectException`, as shown below.


[.ex]

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="testExceptions" description="Test Exceptions" expectException="">
  <flow-ref name="exceptionFlow"/>
</munit:test>
----
=====

The attribute `expectException` expects one of the following:

* A literal exception class name (canonical form)
* A MEL expression

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="testExceptions" description="Test Exceptions" expectException="java.lang.RuntimeException">
  <flow-ref name="exceptionFlow"/>
</munit:test>
----
=====

If you define that your test expects an exception and none is thrown, the test fails immediately.

==== expectException - Literal Value

When you provide a literal value, it should take the form of the _canonical class name_ of the exception that is expected. In these cases, Mule always throws a `MuleMessagingException`. MUnit validates the provided classname if the underlying cause of the `MuleMessagingException` thrown is of the exact same type.

TIP: When providing exceptions in this way, a subclass of the provided exception does not pass the validation -- MUnit looks for the exact same type.

==== expectException - MEL Expression Value

If you choose to use expressions, Mule itself offers a collection of MEL expressions that simplifies the validations of the exceptions thrown.

[cols="30,70"]
|===
|Name |Description

|`exception.causedBy(exception_type)`
|Evaluates if the exception was caused by an (instance of) the provided exception type.
*Example*: `exception.causedBy(org.mule.example.ExceptionType)`

|`exception.causedExactlyBy(exception_type)`
|Evaluates if the exception was caused by the specific exception type provided, discarding all other exception types. For example, if the provided exception type is `NullPointerException`, the expression returns true only if the test returns a NullPointerException.
*Example*: `exception.causedExactlyBy(org.mule.example.ExceptionType)`

|`exception.causeMatches(<regex>)`
|Checks the cause exception type name matches the provided regex. Supports any java regex plus, prefix, suffix. *Example*: `exception.causeMatches(org.mule.example.*)`

|===

TIP: You can combine any expressions as a boolean expression. For example: +
`exception.causeMatches('*') && !exception.causedBy(java.lang.ArithmeticException) &&
!exception.causedBy(org.mule.api.registry.ResolverException)`

This MEL expression is meant to be used with the expressions listed above, but no verification is performed done to avoid other usages. The only contract being enforced is: *The MEL expression should return a boolean value. If true, the test is successful*.

If the MEL expression returns something that cannot be cast to a Boolean value, the test fails.

All MEL expression shortcuts, such as `message` or `payload`, are valid. Just bear in mind that if an exception is thrown, the original payload most likely is lost.
