The base file in the MUnit Framework is the MUnit Test Suite file. These files are the XML files located under the src/test/munit folder in your Mule application's folder structure. Each MUnit Test Suite file is a collection of MUnit tests. It is meant to work on its own, and should be able to run independently from other MUnit test suite files.

An MUnit test suite file should contain any combination of the following components:

* Before/After Suite
* Before/After Tests
* MUnit Tests

Each MUnit test suite file is, behind the scenes, no different than a Mule application XML file. +
You can use several of the Mule top level elements such as flow, sub-flow, and scripts.
