The Verify Event processor allows you to verify if a processor was called.

For example, you can validate if a specific processor has been called with a particular set of attributes a specific number of times.

When defining a verification, you are telling MUnit to fail a test if the verification is not successful.

You can define verifications over any processor, even if you haven't created a mock for it.

|Attribute Name |Description

|`eventProcessor`
|Describes which event processor you want to mock. The description takes the form `\{name-space}:\{event-processor-name}`. It supports regular expressions.

|`times`
|*(Default = 1.)* Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called _N_ and only _N_ number of times.

|`atLeast`
|Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called a minimum of _N_ number of times.

|`atMost`
|Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called maximum of _N_ number of times.

|===

The attributes `times`, `atLeast`, `atMost`, are mutually exclusive.

The `eventProcessor` attribute accepts regular expressions. For example, you can create the same verification as `.*:request` to verify for an event processor named request, disregarding which namespace the event processor belongs to. The regular expression language is the same as Java.
