MUnit allows you to have a log configuration specifically for your tests. In this way, you can log information differently from the way that your Mule application logs. To do this, you need a file called `log4j2-test.xml` with the desired log configuration for your tests. This file overrides any log configuration for Mule applications, but it is used only when running MUnit tests.

An example of a `log4j2-test.xml` file is shown below.

</Configuration>
----

This configuration disables logs like _cxf_ or _apache commons_. It also sets the logger message processor to `DEBUG` mode. If you don't specify the logging mode the default is `ERROR`.

TIP: The configuration file must reside in the classpath to work correctly. Preferably, the file should reside in the `src/test/resources` folder, since this a resource you use when running your tests, and the folder belongs to the classpath.

NOTE: If you don't create a `log4j2-test.xml` file, Mule looks for a file called `log4j2.xml`. For additional information about the priority in which the log configuration files are selected, see xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc[Logging in Mule].
