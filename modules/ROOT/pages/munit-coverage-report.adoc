The MUnit Coverage feature provides a measurement of how much of a Mule application has been executed by a set of MUnit tests by counting the amount of event processors executed. This allows you to obtain a quality standard for your application, and provides metrics for:

* Application overall coverage: An average of the items below.
* Resource coverage: Refers to each Mule configuration file under src/main/mule.
* Flow coverage: Refers to any of the following components: Flows, Sub-flows, and Batch jobs.

Coverage report runs only for EE edition runtimes. If your application has a `requiredProduct` of a Mule CE runtime you will see the following message: *Coverage is a EE only feature and you've selected to run over CE*. To run against an EE runtime see xref:munit-maven-plugin.adoc#specify-runtime-product[Specifying the Runtime Product].

The following is a coverage report sample in JSON format. +
Use the code callouts below to understand each field in the report:
