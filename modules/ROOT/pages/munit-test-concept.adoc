= About MUnit Test

endif::[]

The MUnit Test is the basic processor of an MUnit Test Suite. It represents each test scenario you want to try.

The MUnit Test is divided in three scopes:

[%header,cols="20,80"]
|===
|Scope |Description

| Behavior
| The behavior scope is meant to set all the preconditions before executing the test logic.

| Execution
| The execution scope is meant to have the testing logic which will be wait for all processes to finish before executing the next scope.

| Validation
| The validation scope is meant to have all the validations regarding the result of the execution scope.
|===


All these scopes are optional.

<munit:test name="exampleTest" description="Test to verify scenario 1">>

     <munit:behavior>
         <!-- Processors to set preconditions for the test -->
     </munit:behavior>

     <munit:execution>

== About MUnit Test Description Attribute

In MUnit 2.2.0 and later, it is optional that you write a description in your test. +
Ideally, you should write a useful, representative description of the scenario you are testing. This description displays in the test console before running the test, and also in the reports. +
The more representative the description, the easier to read and troubleshoot any failures.

== About MUnit Test Ignore Attribute

There may be scenarios where you need to shut down a test. Whether this be because the test is failing or because it has nasty side effects. +
The point is you shouldn't have to comment out the code.

In this case, MUnit allows you to ignore a specific test.

You can ignore any of your tests by adding the ignore boolean to the test definition.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="my-flow-Test"
      ignore="true"
      description="Test to verify scenario 1">
</munit:test>
----

[TIP]
Valid values for `ignore` are true and false. If the attribute is not present, the default is false.

.In Anypoint Studio, you can check the Ignore Test option.

=== Using expressions to ignore a test

Since MUnit 2.2, the `ignore` attribute allows expression to be used. This allows you to ignore a test based on the
current mule version or on the current OS.

.Ignoring a test based on the mule version
[source,xml]
----
<munit:test name="linux-ignore-test" ignore="#[Munit::osEqualTo('Mac OS X')]">
----

.Ignoring a test based on the Operating System
[source,xml]
----
<munit:test name="mule-version-ignore-test" ignore="#[Munit::muleVersionPriorTo('4.1.4')]">
----

This test will be ignored if the Mule version is prior to `4.1.4`. Other possible functions are `muleVersionEqualTo` and
`muleVersionNewerThan`.

== About MUnit Test Tag Attribute

MUnit also allows you to tag your tests, so you can choose to run tests under a specific tag. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test
  name="exampleTest"
  description="A test that works as an example"
  ignore="true"
  tags="integration,http" >
		…
</munit:test>
----


.In Anypoint Studio, you can define tags in the proper field.

== About MUnit Test TimeOut Attribute

Each MUnit test will automatically fail if it takes more than 2 minutes to complete. Sometimes, that time can be too long or too short. +
In that case, you can use the `timeOut` attribute, where you can set the desired maximum time -in milliseconds- that the test can run before failing. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test
  name="custom-timeout-test"
  description="This test has a timeout of 10 seconds"
  timeOut="10000" >
  ....
</munit:test>
----

== About MUnit Test Expected Error and Exception Attributes

Sometimes, the only thing you want to validate is that the flow or sub-flow you are testing fails and throws a specific error, which depends on the business logic being tested. In these cases, MUnit provides a simple way to validate the scenario. +
You can add the attribute expectedErrorType and expectException, as shown below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="MUnit-test-suite"
  description="A test that works as an example"
  expectedErrorType="RETRY_EXHAUSTED"
  expectedException="java.lang.RuntimeException">
  ...
</munit:test>
----

.A visual representation on Anypoint Studio
image::munit-test-concept-e7280.png[]

* The attribute expectedErrorType expects an error ID that needs to be defined inside the application being tested.
:: This attribute allows you to validate that a defined error type in your application is thrown. If you define an errorType that does not exists in your application, the test does not run.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="MUnit-test-suite"
  description="Test Error Type"
  expectedErrorType="FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH">
  ...
</munit:test>
----
+
This Error Type test expects that an FTP operation will throw an FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH error. +
If none of your flows are using using an FTP connector, then the error type is not defined within your application and the test will not run.
+
[TIP]
ErrorTypes that belong to the Mule Runtime does not need to be typified. For example, MULE:RETRY_EXHAUSTED can be defined as simply RETRY_EXHAUSTED.

* The attribute expectException expects a literal exception class name (canonical form).
:: When you provide a literal value, it should take the form of the canonical class name of the exception that is expected. In these cases, Mule always throws a `MuleMessagingException`. MUnit validates the provided classname if the underlying cause of the `MuleMessagingException` thrown is of the exact same type.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="testExceptions"
  description="Test Exceptions"
  expectedException="java.lang.RuntimeException">
  ...
</munit:test>
----
+
If you define that your test expects an exception and none is thrown, the test fails immediately.
