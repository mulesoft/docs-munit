The Assert That event processor allows you to run assertions to validate the state of a Mule event's content. You can use the Assert That processor to validate the Mule event after the production code runs.

The Assert That processor uses a set of DataWeave functions called `MUnit matchers` to define the assertion conditions for any value in an expression.

For example, to assert that a payload is equal to a certain value, configure the Assert That processor using the `equalTo()` matcher.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert-that
  expression="#[payload]"
  is="#[MunitTools::equalTo('example')]"
  message="The payload should be ‘example’"/>
----

Or you can also check if the payload is null using the `nullValue()` matcher.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert-that
  expression="#[payload]"
  is="#[MunitTools::nullValue()]"
  message="The payload should be null"/>
----

See xref:munit-matchers.adoc[MUnit Matchers] for more information.

If these assertion fails, the processor throws a `java.lang.AssertionError`.
