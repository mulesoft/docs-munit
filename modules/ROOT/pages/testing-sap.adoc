== Overview

This document contains a basic example for testing SAP-based applications. +
The SAP connector requires a set of specific libraries which are listed in the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::sap-connector.adoc#requirements[SAP Connector requirements] documentation. These libraries need to be added manually in order to test the SAP-based application correctly.

Find below the configuration needed to test a SAP connector <<From studio,using studio>> or <<From Maven,using Maven>> respectively:

== Configuration

=== From Studio

In your Studio environment:

. Add the SAP libraries to the classpath:
.. Navigate to *Build Path > Configure Build Path*
.. In the *Libraries* tab, click the *Add Library ...* button
.. Select *Anypoint Connectors Dependencies*
.. Select the *SAP Connector* option.
+
[TIP]
--
This process is also described in the xref:3.9@mule-runtime::sap-connector-troubleshooting.adoc#solution[SAP Connector documentation].
--
+
. You may also need to make the `java.library.path` point to the folder where the native libraries are located. +
The MUnit Studio plugin will try to find these native libraries and configure them automatically when you try to run your tests. In case they are not found, you need to add the following _vm argument_ in the run configuration:
.. In Studio top navigation bar, click *run*
.. Click *Run Configurations...*
.. Select the *Arguments* tab
.. In the *VM Arguments* dialog box, type the path to your libraries with the `java.library.path` argument. +
*Example*: `-Djava.library.path=path/to/lib`
+

=== From Maven

One way of adding the libraries to the classpath is using the xref:munit-maven-plugin-configuration.adoc#additional-classpath-elements[additionalClasspathElements] parameter in the maven plugin. +
You can provide the path to each of the SAP libraries that you want to add:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<additionalClasspathElements>
  <additionalClasspathElement>/path/to/lib/sapjco3.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
  <additionalClasspathElement>/path/to/lib/sapidoc3.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
</additionalClasspathElements>
----

[TIP]
--
If there is already a sap dependency in the pom, but the library name doesn't match SAP naming restrictions, you may need to exclude them from the test run. +
This way the libraries added with the `additionalClassPathElement` parameter will take precedence:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<classpathDependencyExcludes>
  <classpathDependencyExclude>com.sap.conn.idoc:sapidoc3</classpathDependencyExclude>
  <classpathDependencyExclude>com.sap.conn.jco:sapjco3</classpathDependencyExclude>
</classpathDependencyExcludes>
----
--

Additionally, you need to make the `java.library.path` property point to the native libraries directory, similar to how it's done in Studio. +
To accomplish this, you can use the xref:munit-maven-plugin-configuration.adoc#additional-argument-lines[argLine] parameter to add the additional vm argument.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<argLines>
     <argLine>-Djava.library.path=/path/to/native/lib/folder</argLine>
</argLines>
----

[CAUTION]
The mentioned Maven Plugin configuration parameters are available since MUnit 1.3.5
