MUnit allows you to test applications that run referencing a Mule Domain. +
MUnit support for domain based applications is designed to require the minimum change of code from your end to implement it. However if your Mule Application depends on a Mule Domain, there are a few considerations to take into account:

* When working in Anypoint Studio, your Mule Domain must always be part of your workspace.
* Your Folder must have the same name as your artifact. +
Regardless if it's a Mule application or a Mule domain if, the folder in your workspace containing your Mule project must have the same name as the artifact ID defined in your pom file.
+
For example, if your mule project's artifact Id is:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<artifactId>mule-project</artifactId>
----
+
Then, the folder in your Studio workspace must be named `mule-project`. +
This is case sensitive. If your folder is named `Mule-Project`, MUnit won't recognize your project.
* Your resources need to be installed in an M2 repository. +
You need to handle domains and mule apps as regular dependencies. Setting them as an artifact requires for them to be installed in an .M2 repository.
* Your resources need to be in your test suite pom file.
+
If your Mule domain project looks like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
<groupId>org.mule.app</groupId>
<artifactId>domain-project</artifactId>
<packaging>mule-domain</packaging>
<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<name>Domain domain-project Project</name>
----
+
Then your dependency in your Mule application should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>domain-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <classifier>mule-domain</classifier>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
[TIP]
--
Remember to keep consistency with `<version>` artifact in your repository and in your test suite's pom file
