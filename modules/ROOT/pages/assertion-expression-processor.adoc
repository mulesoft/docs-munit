The Assert Expression processor allows you evaluate a Dataweave expression that asserts the state of a Mule Event's content. This processor can be used to validate the Mule Event after the production code runs, using the xref:dataweave-assertions-library.adoc[DataWeave Assertions Library].

For example, to assert that a payload is equal to a certain value, you can configure the Assert-Expression processor using the equalTo() matcher.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert>
    <munit-tools:that>#[ import * from dw::test::Asserts ---
        payload must equalTo('example') ]
    </munit-tools:that>
</munit-tools:assert>
----

== Perform Complex Assertions

The DW assertions library allows you to assert the state of the Mule Event's content in a deeper way.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert>
    <munit-tools:that>#[ import * from dw::test::Asserts ---
        vars.attributes must [beObject(), $.statusCode must equalTo(200), $.method must equalTo('GET')] ]
    </munit-tools:that>
</munit-tools:assert>
----


== Create your own Matcher

To create your own matcher, you can add DW files to your `src/test/resources` folder. For example, a file called
`MyMatcher.dwl` with the following content:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
import * from dw::test::Asserts

fun beEven(): Matcher<Number> =
     (actual:Number) -> do {
         var matchesEven = (actual mod 2) == 0
         ---
         {
             matches: matchesEven,
             description: {expected: " to be an even number.", actual: write(actual) as String}
         }
     }

----

And then use it in your Assert-Expression processor:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert>
    <munit-tools:that>#[ import * from dw::test::Asserts ---
        payload must MyMatcher::beEven() ]
    </munit-tools:that>
</munit-tools:assert>
----

If this assertion fails, the processor throws a `java.lang.AssertionError`.

[WARNING]
--
Matchers from the `dw::test::Asserts` library are not compatible with the `MunitTools` matchers. You can't use `dw::test::Asserts` with the Assert-That processor, and you can't use `MunitTools` matchers with the Assert-Expression processor.
