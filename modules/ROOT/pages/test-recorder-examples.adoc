The following example shows you how to import to Anypoint Studio an existing project from Anypoint Exchange and then record the flow processing to create a unit test for the flows.

== Prerequisite

* Your Anypoint Platform credentials are configured in Studio. +
See xref:studio::set-credentials-in-studio-to.adoc[Configuring Anypoint Platform Credentials] for more information.

== Test the Login Form Using the HTTP Connector Example

. Click the Open Exchange icon image:exchange-icon.png[3%,3%].
. Select *Provided by MuleSoft* in the pop-up Exchange window, filter per *Examples*, and look for the *Login Form Using the HTTP Connector*.
. Click *Open*. +
Studio imports the example as a new working project.
. If prompted, select *Perform Update* in *Update your Workspace*.
. Select the Manage Mule Projects APIs icon image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%].
. Select *Modules* and update both *MUnit* and *Munit Tools*:
+

. Select *Apply and Close*.

=== Test the Process for a Successful Login Attempt

//tag::this-test[]
. In your project, right-click `DoLoginFlow` and select *Munit* > *Record new test for this flow*:
+

+
The test recorder starts your project and starts recording the event going through that flow.
. Open a browser and navigate to `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/login+`.
//end::this-test[]
. Type `mule` for both *Username* and *Password*, and click *Submit*.
//tag::also-this[]
+
The test recorder captures this event and stops the recording.
. Return to Studio and click *Configure Test*:
+
image::stops-recording.png[]
. Select the file name for the MUnit test suite in which you want to record your test.
//end::also-this[]
. Under *Test name*, type `_DoLoginFlow-successfull_`.
. Set the test recorder to set the recorded input of the flow, and assert that the recorded output is the expected output by the test.
. In *Successful login*, select *Verify that this process was called* and set the counter *equal to* to `_1_` time.
. Click *Next* and then *Finish*.
+
A fully functional MUnit test is generated to assert that the process in your application works as expected when the login is successful.

=== Test the Process for an Unsuccessful Login Attempt

include::page$test-recorder-examples.adoc[tag=this-test]
. Type `admin` in both *Username* and *Password*, and click *Submit*: +
include::page$test-recorder-examples.adoc[tag=also-this]
. Under *Test name*, type `_DoLoginFlow-unsuccessfull_`.
. Set the test recorder to set the recorded input of the flow, and assert that the recorded output is the expected output by the test.
. In the *Unsuccessful login* parse template step, select *Verify that this process was called* and set the counter to *equal to* `_1_` time.
. Click *Next* and then *Finish*.
+
A fully functional MUnit test is generated to assert that the process in your application works as expected when the login fails.
