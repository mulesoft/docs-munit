You can run a coverage report from Anypoint Studio.

The following configurations apply only when you execute your MUnit tests in Studio. They do not apply when running tests from Maven in a CI/CD environment. +
To run coverage reports from Maven see xref:coverage-maven-concept.adoc[].

== Enable Coverage Reports in Anypoint Studio

The Coverage button enables you to see which flows, and which percentage of event processors in those flows the test covers:

The Overall Coverage value represents the percentage of the Mule application event processors that the MUnit test executes.

You can click *Generate Report* to get the report that details the flows and event processors in the Mule configuration files that are included in the MUnit test.
