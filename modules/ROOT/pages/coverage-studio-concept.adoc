You can run a coverage report from Anypoint Studio.

The following configurations apply only when you execute your MUnit tests in Studio. They do not apply when running tests from Maven in a CI/CD environment. +
To run coverage reports from Maven see xref:coverage-maven-concept.adoc[Using Coverage in Maven].

== Enable Coverage Reports in Anypoint Studio

The Coverage button in the image below allows you to see which flows, and which percentage of event processors in those
flows were covered by the test:

The Overall Coverage value represents the percentage of the Mule application event processors that have been executed by the MUnit test.

You can click the Generate Report button to get the report detailing the flows and event processors contained by the Mule configuration files that were included in the MUnit test.

| Column      | Description
| *Resource*    | The name of the Mule Configuration file.
| *Containers* | Number of Flows inside the Mule configuration file.
| *Weight*      | This field represents how much of your application is contained inside a configuration file. +
                It is calculated as a percentage of the overall number of event processors in the documentation and the
                amount of event processors contained in the Mule configuration file.
| *Coverage*    | This field represents the percentage of the event processors inside the Mule Configuration file that
                were executed in the MUnit test.

Additionally, you can click on each Resource, to get a more specific and granular report of the Event Processors executed in that resource:

| *Covered Processors* | The processors inside the container that were executed during the MUnit test.
| *Processors*         | The total amount of processors inside the container.
| *Coverage*            | This field represents the percentage of the event processors inside the container executed in the MUnit test.

== Disable Coverage Reports

If you choose so, you can disable the coverage calculation from your project's run configuration.

Right-click in your Package Explorer, and choose *Run As* and *Run Configurations...*, select your MUnit run configuration file to access your suite's configuration, and deselect the "Run coverage" option under your coverage settings.
